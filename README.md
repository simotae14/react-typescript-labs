## Running Storybook

All of the examples are exposed as stories. To run Storybook, execute the following from your command line.

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Running Examples

If Storybook is not working for you for some reason, this project includes multiple examples and labs that cover using TypeScript with React.

```bash
npm run examples
```

This will launch an interactive menu where you can:

- Use **↑↓ arrow keys** to navigate through available examples
- Press **Enter** to select an example
- Press **Ctrl+C** or **Esc** to quit

The CLI will automatically update `index.html` to load the selected example. After selecting, run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

Once you've selected an example, start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
